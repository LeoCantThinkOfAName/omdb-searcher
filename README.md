OMDB Searcher is a Harvard cs50 mobile project, made with `React Native`, handcrafted by me :P   
In this project, I tried to play with `react navigation` basically `stack navigation`, and a lil bit of `Animated` items, which are pretty fun actually :D

The whole project was build with `expo`, and using all the data from `OMDB` obciously.

LCTOAN.
